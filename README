CLSQL is a Common Lisp to SQL engine interface written by Kevin M.
Rosenberg. It includes both functional and object oriented subsystems
for data definition and manipulation as well as an integrated symbolic
SQL syntax. 

CLSQL supports a number of RDBMS and uses the UFFI (http://uffi.b9.com) 
library for compatibility with Allegro CL, Lispworks, CMUCL, SBCL and
OpenMCL.

CLSQL is based on Pierre R. Mai's excellent MaiSQL package and
UncommonSQL developed at onShore Development Inc.

CLSQL's home is http://clsql.b9.com.

Documentation is availabe as a PDF file in doc/clsql.pdf and as HTML
files in doc/html.tar.gz.
