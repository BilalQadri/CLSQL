INTRODUCTIION 

CLSQL-USQL is a high level SQL interface for Common Lisp which is
based on the CommonSQL package from Xanalys. It was originally
developed at Onshore Development, Inc. based on Pierre Mai's MaiSQL
package. It now incorporates some of the code developed for CLSQL. See
the files CONTRIBUTORS and COPYING for more details.

CLSQL-USQL depends on the low-level database interfaces provided by
CLSQL and includes both a functional and an object oriented
interface to SQL RDBMS.

PREREQUISITES

  o COMMON LISP: currently CMUCL, SBCL, Lispworks 
  o RDBMS: currently Postgresql, Mysql, Sqlite 
  o ASDF (from http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cclan/asdf/)
  o CLSQL-2.0.0 or later (from http://clsql.b9.com)
  o RT for running the test suite (from http://files.b9.com/rt/rt.tar.gz)


INSTALLATION 

Just load clsql-usql.asd or put it somewhere where ASDF can find it
and call:

(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :clsql-usql)

You'll then need to load a CLSQL backend before you can do anything. 

To run the regression tests load clsql-usql-tests.asd or put it
somewhere where ASDF can find it, edit the file tests/test-init.lisp
and set the following variables to appropriate values:

    *test-database-server*
    *test-database-name*
    *test-database-user*
    *test-database-password* 

And then call:

(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :clsql-usql-tests)
(usql-tests:test-usql BACKEND)

where BACKEND is the CLSQL database interface to use (currently one of
:postgresql, :postgresql-socket, :sqlite or :mysql).
