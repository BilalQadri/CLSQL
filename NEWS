- Added optional field types specifier for queries to optimize query 
times, reduce garbage, reduce programmer effort to convert strings to 
numbers. By directly parsing integers (32 and 64 bits) and floats, the 
overhead of temporary strings is eliminated. A value of :auto 
specifies automatic numeric importing for applicable fields. 

- New test suite using XPTest

- Documentation improvements
