DOCUMENTATION TO DO LIST

1. Variances from CommonSQL

 - Ideally, this will be extremely minimal

2. Underdocumented CommonSQL features:

 - Retrieval immediate
 - SQL operators: ||, SUBSTR, MINUS, INTERSECT, UNION, NVL 

2. CLSQL extensions to CommonSQL

 - RESULT-TYPES, FIELD-NAMES keywords for SELECT and QUERY

 - New types such as wall-time, boolean, and bigint

 - SQL operators: group-by, limit, not-null, ==, is, having, the, uplike,
   sql-view-class, coalesce, except (just from a quick scan of 
   operations.lisp)

 - FDDL: list-views, view-exists-p, list-indexes, list-table-indexes,
   index-exists-p, create-sequence, drop-sequence, list-sequences,
   sequence-exists-p, sequence-next, sequence-last, set-sequence-position

 - OODML: *db-auto-sync*

 - SELECT: additional keyword arguments accepted include :LIMIT, :OFFSET, 
   :INNER-JOIN and :ON. 

4. Documenting lower level, non-CommonSQL functions (some of this is already 
   done). 

 - connection pools
 - database-query-result-set 

5. Notes on any peculiarities of each of the backends (e.g., unsupported 
   features, notable extensions etc.). 

 - MYSQL 

   drop-index:   requires a table to be specified with the :from parameter
   views:        mysql does not support views  
   queries:      nested subqueries are not supported
   syntax:       doesn't support the sql concatenation operator (||). 
                 doesn't support INTERSECT/EXCEPT set operations. 

 - SQLITE 

   connection:   specifying ":memory:" gives you an SQLite database in RAM.
   create-view:  column-list parameter not supported 
   syntax:       doesn't support the sql SUBSTRING operator.
