DOCUMENTATION TO DO LIST

1. Variances from CommonSQL (Ideally, this will be extremely minimal) 

 - The SQL syntax state functions are macros in CLSQL. 

 - CLSQL starts with in transaction AUTOCOMMIT mode. To begin a transaction,
   START-TRANSACTION has to be called.


2. Underdocumented CommonSQL features:

 - Retrieval immediate
 - SQL operators: ||, SUBSTR, MINUS, INTERSECT, UNION, NVL 


3. CLSQL extensions to CommonSQL

 - New types such as wall-time, boolean, and bigint

 - SQL operators: group-by, limit, not-null, ==, is, having, the, uplike,
   sql-view-class, coalesce, except (just from a quick scan of 
   operations.lisp)

 - FDML: FOR-EACH-ROW, prepared statements and large object support. 

 - OODML: *db-auto-sync*

 - SELECT: additional keyword arguments accepted include :LIMIT, :OFFSET, 
   :INNER-JOIN and :ON. 

 - DEF-VIEW-CLASS: DB-CONSTRAINTS, DB-TYPE and VOID-VALUE slot options. 


4. Documenting lower level, non-CommonSQL functions (some of this is already 
   done). 

 - connection pools
 - database-query-result-set 
 

5. Notes on any peculiarities of each of the backends (e.g., unsupported 
   features, notable extensions etc.). 

 - MYSQL 

   drop-index:   requires a table to be specified with the :on parameter
   views:        mysql does not support views  
   queries:      nested subqueries are not supported
   syntax:       doesn't support the sql concatenation operator (||). 
                 doesn't support INTERSECT/EXCEPT set operations. 
   create-table: the transactions keyword arg controls whether the created 
                 table is an InnoDB table (supporting transactions) or not. 
   FDDL:         list-*/*-exists-p: :OWNER keyword argument ignored. 

 - SQLITE 

   connection:   specifying ":memory:" gives you an SQLite database in RAM.
   create-view:  column-list parameter not supported 
   syntax:       doesn't support the sql SUBSTRING operator. 
   FDDL:         list-*/*-exists-p: :OWNER keyword argument ignored. 

 - ODBC 

   FDDL:         list-*/*-exists-p: :OWNER keyword argument ignored.
