DOCUMENTATION TO DO LIST

1. Variances from CommonSQL

 - Ideally, this will be extremely minimal

2. Underdocumented CommonSQL features:

 - Retrieval immediate
 - SQL operators: ||, SUBSTR, EXCEPT, INTERSECT, UNION ...

2. CLSQL extensions to CommonSQL

 - RESULT-TYPES, FIELD-NAMES keywords for SELECT and QUERY

 - New types such as wall-time, boolean, and bigint

 - SQL operators: group-by, limit, not-null, ==, is, having, the, uplike,
   sql-view-class (just from a quick scan of operations.lisp)

 - FDDL: list-views, view-exists-p, list-indexes, list-table-indexes,
   index-exists-p, create-sequence, drop-sequence, list-sequences,
   sequence-exists-p, sequence-next, sequence-last, set-sequence-position

 - OODML: *db-auto-sync*

4. Documenting lower level, non-CommonSQL functions like connection
   pools and database-query-result-set. Some of this is already done.

5. Notes on any features unsupported by each of the backends.
