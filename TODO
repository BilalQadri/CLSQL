 >> Initialisation and connection 

    CONNECT 
     o should accept string as connection spec 

    DISCONNECT
     o should accept string as connection spec 

    INITIALIZE-DATABASE-TYPE
     o should initialise appropriate backend 

    STATUS 
     o what is the behaviour in CommonSQL (esp :full parameter)? 


 >> The functional sql interface 
  
    SELECT 
      o should accept keyword arg :refresh and call INSTANCE-REFRESHED
      o should return (values result-list field-names)
      o should coerce values returned as strings to appropriate lisp type

    QUERY 
      o should return (values result-list field-names) 
      o should coerce values returned as strings to appropriate lisp type

    LIST-ATTRIBUTE-TYPES
      o should return list of (attribute datatype precision scale nullable) 	

    LOOP 
      o the extension is currently CMUCL specific 


 >> The object-oriented sql interface

    DEF-VIEW-CLASS
      o get :target-slot working 
      o implement :retrieval :immediate 

    LIST-CLASSES 
      o keyword arg :root-class should do something (portable)

    DO-QUERY,MAP-QUERY,LOOP
      o should work with object queries as well as functional ones 


 >> Symbolic SQL syntax 

      o Complete sql expressions (see operations.lisp)

         substr
         some 
         order-by 
         times 
         nvl
         null 
         distinct
         except 
         intersect 
         between
         userenv

      o variables (e.g., table identifiers) should be instantiated at runtime
