TESTS TO ADD

* CACHE-TABLE-QUERIES
* Test that ":db-kind :key" adds an index for that key. This is complicated by different
  backends showing autogenerated primary key in different ways.
* Test bigint type
* :db-constraint tests
* test *db-auto-sync* 
* for-each-row macro
* universal-time 
* owner phrases for postgresql and oracle backends
* test of large table with large numbers of rows, greater than 2x the number of
  rows (200) returned by the oracle backend at a time
* Number and Char field types

COMMONSQL INCOMPATIBILITY

   o userenv (Oracle specific but deprecated in Oracle 9) 
 
VARIANCES FROM COMMONSQL

CLSQL starts with in transaction AUTOCOMMIT mode. To begin a transaction,
START-TRANSACTION has to be called.

OPTIMIZATIONS
 
* Revisit result-type list creation, perhaps caching

POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS

* extend large object support to databases beyond postgresql, improve large object api
* add support for prepared statements
* port Oracle backend to UFFI
