COMMONSQL SPEC

  UPDATE-OBJECT-JOINS 

* Incompatible 


 >> Initialisation and connection 

    STATUS 
     o what is the behaviour in CommonSQL (esp :full parameter)? 


 >> The functional sql interface 
  
    SELECT 
      o keyword arg :refresh should function as advertised 
      o should return (values result-list field-names)
      o should coerce values returned as strings to appropriate lisp type

    QUERY 
      o should coerce values returned as strings to appropriate lisp type
	(except for SQLite interface, this works when :result-types is :auto).
	Perhaps that should be the default?

 >> The object-oriented sql interface

    DEF-VIEW-CLASS
      o get :target-slot working 
      o implement :retrieval :immediate 

    DO-QUERY,MAP-QUERY,LOOP
      o should work with object queries as well as functional ones 


 >> Symbolic SQL syntax 

      o Complete sql expressions (see operations.lisp)

         substr
         some 
         order-by 
         times 
         nvl
         null 
         distinct
         except 
         intersect 
         between
         userenv

      o variables (e.g., table identifiers) should be instantiated at runtime
