TESTS TO ADD

* CACHE-TABLE-QUERIES
* Test that ":db-kind :key" adds an index for that key. This is complicated by different
  backends showing autogenerated primary key in different ways.
* :db-constraint tests
* test *db-auto-sync* 
* for-each-row macro
* owner phrases for postgresql and oracle backends
* Number and Char field types
* Add test case for return type of (setf slot-value-using-class)
* symbol slot

OPTIMIZATIONS

POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS

* extend large object support to databases beyond postgresql, improve large object api
* add support for prepared statements
* port Oracle backend to UFFI
