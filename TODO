TESTS TO ADD

* CACHE-TABLE-QUERIES
* Test that ":db-kind :key" adds an index for that key. This is complicated by different
  backends showing autogenerated primary key in different ways.
* Test bigint type
* :db-constraint tests
* test *db-auto-sync* 
* for-each-row macro
* universal-time 
* owner phrases for postgresql and oracle backends
* test of large table with large numbers of rows, greater than 2x the number of
  rows (200) returned by the oracle backend at a time

COMMONSQL INCOMPATIBILITY

   o doesn't support CHAR and NUMBER types as shown on CREATE-TABLE reference page
   o (string n) => VARCHAR(n) rather than CHAR(n)
   o userenv (Oracle specific but deprecated in Oracle 9) 
 
VARIANCES FROM COMMONSQL

COMMIT,ROLLBACK,START-TRANSACTION: 
 When COMMIT or ROLLBACK are called outside of WITH-TRANSACTION, an sql 
 transaction must be explicitly started first with START-TRANSACTION. 

OPTIMIZATIONS
 
* Revisit result-type list creation, perhaps caching

POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS

* extend large object support to databases beyond postgresql, improve large object api
* add support for prepared statements
* port Oracle backend to UFFI
