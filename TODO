TESTS TO ADD

* CACHE-TABLE-QUERIES
* Test that ":db-kind :key" adds an index for that key. This is complicated by different
  backends showing autogenerated primary key in different ways.
* Large object testing
* Test bigint type
* :db-constraint tests
* *update-records-on-make-instance*
* test :retrieval :deferred joins

COMMONSQL SPEC

* Missing: 

  UPDATE-OBJECT-JOINS 

* Incompatible 

 >> The functional sql interface 
  
    SELECT 
      o keyword arg :refresh should function as advertised 

    DEF-VIEW-CLASS
      o Rework functioning of :immediate to be conformant. It 
     works as expect with target-slot, but not without target-slot

 >> Symbolic SQL syntax 

      o Complete sql expressions (see operations.lisp)

         substr
         some 
         order-by 
         times 
         nvl
         null 
         distinct
         except 
         intersect 
         between
         userenv

      o variables (e.g., table identifiers) should be instantiated at runtime 

OPTIMIZATIONS

* Revisit result-type list creation,perhaps caching

POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS

* port Oracle backend to UFFI
* large object support 
* add support for prepared statements
