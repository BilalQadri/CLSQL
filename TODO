TESTS TO ADD

* CACHE-TABLE-QUERIES
* Test that ":db-kind :key" adds an index for that key. This is complicated by different
  backends showing autogenerated primary key in different ways.
* Test bigint type
* :db-constraint tests
* test *db-auto-sync* 
* for-each-row macro
* universal-time 
* owner phrases for postgresql and oracle backends

COMMONSQL INCOMPATIBILITY

   o userenv (Oracle specific but deprecated in Oracle 9) 

VARIANCES FROM COMMONSQL

COMMIT,ROLLBACK,START-TRANSACTION: 
 When COMMIT or ROLLBACK are called outside of WITH-TRANSACTION, an sql 
 transaction must be explicitly started first with START-TRANSACTION. 

OPTIMIZATIONS
 
* Revisit result-type list creation, perhaps caching

POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS

* extend large object support to databases beyond postgresql, improve large object api
* add support for prepared statements
* port Oracle backend to UFFI
