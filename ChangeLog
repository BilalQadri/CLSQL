	* Added field-types parameter to query, database-query,
	database-query-result-set, map-query. Haven't added code
	to utilize field types, yet.

	* Changed postgresql-socket result set from cons to a structure

	* Updated test-clsql.cl to use automated testing with a config
	file

	* Changed return types of field accessors from cstring to (* :unsigned-char).
	This prepares for being able to use specified type conversions when taking
	field data into lisp.
