	* Added field-types parameter to query, database-query,
	database-query-result-set, map-query. Haven't added code
	to utilize field types, yet.

	* Changed postgresql-socket result set from cons to a structure

	* Updated test-clsql.cl to use automated testing with a config
	file

	* Changed return types of field accessors from cstring to
	(* :unsigned-char).  This prepares for being able to use specified
	type conversions when taking field data into lisp.
