	* Separated db-interface and conditions from sql/sql.cl

	* Improved foreign library loading testing
	
27 Mar 2002 Kevin Rosenberg (kevin@rosenberg.net)
	* interfaces/postgresql-socket/postgresql-socket-api.cl:
	Fixes to read-double-from-socket. Added 64-bit integer support.

	* test-suite/xptest-clsql.cl
	Added testint for 64-bit integers

	* Additons to installation docs
	
26 Mar 2002 Kevin Rosenberg (kevin@rosenberg.net)
	* interfaces/postgresql-socket/postgresql-socket-api.cl:
	Implemented direct socket reading for field type :double

	* Added usage information for :types to documentation

	* interfaces/mysql/mysql-sql.cl: Fixed type specifiers in atoi,
	atol, atof calls

	* interfaces/clsql-uffi: Created new directory. Split common
	interface routines that use UFFI into this package. Required
	especially to support direct reading of 64-bit integers into
	bignums and bypassing temporary strings.

	* test-clsql.cl: Updated to test postgresql-socket's
	read-double-from-socket function.
	
	* test-suite/xptest-clsql.cl
	Started work on test suite

	* interfaces/mysql/mysql-api.cl: Added mysql-fetch-fields,
	mysql-fetch-field-direct Got :auto types working

	* interfaces/postgresql/postgresql-api.cl
	* interfaces/postgresql-socket/postgresql-socket-api.cl
	Added pgsql-field-types enum. Got :auto types working.

	* multiple-files
	Renamed :field-types to :types.
	
24 Mar 2002 Kevin Rosenberg (kevin@rosenberg.net)

	* Added field-types parameter to query, database-query,
	database-query-result-set, map-query. Haven't added code
	to utilize field types, yet.

	* Changed postgresql-socket result set from cons to a structure

	* Updated test-clsql.cl to use automated testing with a config
	file

	* Changed return types of field accessors from cstring to
	(* :unsigned-char).  This prepares for being able to use specified
	type conversions when taking field data into lisp.

	* Added field-type processing for most interfaces. Not done yet.
	
23 Mar 2002 Kevin Rosenberg (kevin@rosenberg.net)
	
	* doc/ref.sgml: Updated MAP-QUERY example to use
	*read-default-float-format* (John Foderaro)
	
	* Extensive work to foreign library loaders and .system files to
	check for successful loading of foreign libraries.

	* Modified test-clsql.cl to allow more modularity and
	automated testing in future release.
